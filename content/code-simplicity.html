          <h3>Review #1 Title: Very helpful and practical</h3>

          <p>As a database programmer with a few years of experience, I found this book very helpful. As I read the book, I found myself thinking of many examples in my daily work where it would be helpful to apply the philosophies of Code Simplicity. The general idea of keeping code as simple as doesn't seem to get nearly as much emphasis as it should. For example, while working I'll often come across a very complicated query, usually written that way in an attempt to make it perform as fast as possible. But this book clearly shows how such an approach can have very negative consequences in terms of how difficult it is to maintain the software. Though in some cases it may be necessary to trade simplicity for speed, simplicity should be a very primary concern, and those trade offs should be carefully considered. The author clearly is speaking from a position of experience, and has obviously run into many of the issues caused by overly complex code first hand.

        <h3>Review #2 Title:  One Of The Better Books Of This Kind</h3>

         <p>I spend a lot of time reading books in this vein, Software Craftsmanship, professionalism and agile are all subjects that interest me a great deal.
        </p>
          <p> This book is presented as a science of software, which is really just an angle for the book to present the concepts that are widely held to be true even though empirical evidence in this industry is still thin on the ground.
          </p> 
          <p>
            If you want to be a better programmer, this is a book that will move you along your journey just like The Pragmatic Programmer, The Clean Coder or Software Craftsmanship will have done if you have read any of them.
